# Building Components

## When to use this skill

Use when the user is:

- Building new UI components (primitives, components, blocks, templates)
- Implementing accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Creating composable component APIs (slots, render props, controlled/uncontrolled state)
- Setting up design tokens and theming systems
- Publishing components to npm or a registry
- Writing component documentation
- Implementing polymorphism or as-child patterns
- Working with data attributes for styling/state
